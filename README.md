# matlab-hbm
Implementation of the Generalised Harmonic Balance method in MATLAB. Currently up to 2 base frequencies are supported. The solution can be found in one of the following two ways:

* Fixed base frequency
* Variable base frequency, where an objective is to be maximised/minimised

Each of these different types of problem can then be continued:

* Base frequency as the continuation parameter, thereby yielding a non-linear FRF
* Excitation amplitude as the continuation parameter, thereby yielding the Backbone curve
